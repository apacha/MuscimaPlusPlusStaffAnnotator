# MuscimaPlusPlusStaffAnnotator
A simple WPF application that can be used to annotate staff-lines in images of the MUSCIMA++ dataset

This tool has been used to visually measure where each staff-lines begin and end. It is now deprecated, as the original CVC MUSCIMA dataset contains detailed information on where staff lines begin and end.
